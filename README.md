# ArtistsTopSongs
An app that displays musical artists top ten songs, currently incomplete, concepts are there but putting into practice is harder than expected; will try to finish regardless of results. Currently trying to learn retrofit and recyclerview. Tips appreciated. I had some issues with my computer stopping me from uploading the raw files to github due to some localport blocking android studio's access to github, so I had to zip them up in a rar. 

<br /> The app is suppose to use recyclerview and cardview to first display artists and their profile picture with each cards clickable. Once clicked on another recyclerview and cardview will display the the artist's top 10 tracks via itunes API, the API will have a get request through retrofit, parsing the JSON data with retrofit gson converter then fill the constructors into their respective fields (trackName, collectionName, artistName). While the get request is active a progress circle will appear to stop users from further interacting with the app to complete the request. When the user is done viewing the artist top 10 songs, the user can press back either on the phones nav bar or the back icon at the top to return to the favourite artists list and can choose to view other artists top 10 songs.   

<br /> Do not know how to complete the program, tips will appreciated on how to to complete the program; please email me tips at SimonLytheBoy@gmail.com
